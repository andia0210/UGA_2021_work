# visualization_of_global_live_poultry_trade
Data for international trade of live poultry were obtained from three sources: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), and USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). Historical trade values were adjusted for inflation and expressed in constant 2019 U.S. dollars by the US Inflation Calculator (https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/), which is based on the US government Consumer Price Index (CPI) data published in 2021.
